# NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
The problem of predicting the fare amount for a travel from one location to another is one of the standard problems faced by most of the transportation companies. We take this problem in regard with data specific to New York City. Taxi fare price is dependent on many factors like distance travel, number of passenger, place of travel etc, but distance travel and number of passenger are the most important factors for a taxi fare. Keeping this in mind we trained a regression model which can predict the taxi fare given starting location, drop-off location and number of passengers.
